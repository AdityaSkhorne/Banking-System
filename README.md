# Banking-System
SQL Banking System using Oracle 18c Express Edition.

This project implements a banking system using Oracle 18c Express Edition. It includes SQL queries to create and manage the necessary tables, relationships, and operations within a banking database. The system is designed based on the ER diagram shown below.

# Problem Statement:
In modern banking, managing customer accounts, loans, and payments across various branches is a complex task that involves multiple relationships and entities. The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive database system that efficiently manages the core functionalities of a banking system, such as:

Customer Management: Storing and managing customer information and their relationships with bank accounts.
Account Management: Tracking different types of bank accounts, including savings and checking accounts, along with their balances.
Loan Management: Handling loans issued to customers, their payment schedules, and tracking each loanâ€™s progress.
Employee Management: Keeping track of employees working in different branches, their roles, and their relationship with customers.
Branch Operations: Managing various branches, their assets, and the accounts and loans associated with them.
The system ensures that all transactions, deposits, withdrawals, and loan payments are accurately tracked and that each entity's relationship with others is properly maintained.

**ER Diagram**
